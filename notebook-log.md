This project is aimed at generating a multilocus phylogeny for North Americanspecies in _sect. Amanita_ (subgen _Amanita_, genus _Amanita_). Although this is a phylogenetics project, it's ultimate goal is to interrogate the taxonomy of this section.   

**Data**: 
* publically available GenBank accessions from several species in section _Amanita_. See `./RawData/GB_acc_no` for the accession numbers and taxa sampled. For each taxon, I have tried to get data across all four loci (ITS1, LSU, $\beta$-Tubulin, and EF1-$\alpha$)
* Four loci data extracted from 25 **unpublished** *Amanita muscaria* genomes from across the globe, including invasive populations
* Four loci data from _A. rubescens_ (sect. _Amanitina_ ), which I have chosen for it's static relationship to the members of this section.
