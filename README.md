# Phylogeny of Section _Amanita_ 

This project is aimed at generating a species for sect. Amanita (subgen Amanita, genus Amanita). Although this is a phylogenetics project, it's ultimate goal is to interrogate the taxonomy of this section, to see how applied section names compare with apparent phylogenetic signal.

## Data  
* publically available GenBank accessions from 17 species in subsection _Amanita_, 2 species in subsect. *Pantherinae*, two species in sect. *Amanita* without subsectional placement, and A. caesarea. See `./RawData/GB_acc_no` for the accession numbers and taxa sampled. For each taxon, I have tried to get data across all four loci (ITS1, LSU, $\beta$-Tubulin, and EF1-$\alpha$)
* GenBank Accessions were currated manually and downloaded into four `.fasta.` files. These do not have quality scores and were likely generated by sanger sequencing, making automated QC impossible. Furthermore, `.fasta` files do not contain quality information. 
* Though it was originally my intent to include sequences extracted from private genomes belonging to infraspecific taxa identified as _Amanita muscaria_, I decided against this. It did not add much to the phylogeny. Nevertheless, I've decided to leave the scripts I made to extract the four loci from the genomes for future reference. 

See `notebook-log.md` for the scripts used to perform this analysis.
