**Project Description**: This project will combine seq data from 25 *Amanita* genomes and publically available sequence data to aid in the construction of a multi-locus phylogeny of sect. *Amanita* of that that genus. 

The files ending in `_GenBank.txt` are text files containing the GenBank accession numbers for publically available sequences, labeled according to which taxon they belong.
